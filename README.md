# IFlyPen API Rust SDK

Own an iFlytek Smart Recorder and enjoy free services? Want to quickly convert streaming audio to text? Hoping to quickly summarize the content of your online meetings? With this project, you can bypass hardware limitations to quickly convert local audio files to text, automatically generate meeting minutes, and even call AI models for content summarization and translationâ€”all without relying on iFlytek Smart Recorder hardware to enjoy lifetime free services.

## Project Description

This SDK is implemented based on the reverse engineering of the iFlyrec client protocol and is used to access the IFlyPen API. Key features:
- âœ… Submit local audio files for transcription
- âœ… Get task status and results through this SDK
- ðŸš« Multi-threaded upload support has not been implemented yet
- ðŸš« AI summary generation has not been implemented yet
- ðŸš« Real-time transcription/translation engine has not been implemented yet

### What is the IFlyPen API?

The IFlyPen API is a special version of the iFlyrec client API. This repository is its Rust implementation. This API version provides users who have purchased an iFlytek Smart Recorder with a variety of lifetime free services, such as speech-to-text, AI summarization, and full-text translation.

This project aims to remove iFlytek's restriction on this free API (which requires recordings to be made with an iFlytek Smart Recorder to be eligible for the benefits), providing convenienceenience for users.

## Quick Start

### Dependencies

```bash
cargo add --git https://github.com/yzyf1312/iflypen-api-rs.git
```

### Example

For details, see `src/bin/iflypen-cli.rs`. You can try it out by running `cargo run`.

## Project Structure

The project has been refactored with a modular architecture:

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ api/            # API interaction modules
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ client.rs   # Client implementation
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ constants.rs # API constants and URLs
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ model.rs    # Data models and structures
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ mod.rs      # Module exports
â”œâ”€â”€ error.rs        # Error handling with thiserror
â”œâ”€â”€ util.rs         # Utility functions
â”œâ”€â”€ lib.rs          # Library entry point
â””â”€â”€ bin/            # CLI application
    â””â”€â”€ iflypen-cli.rs
```

### Key Features

- **Modular Design**: Clean separation of concerns with dedicated modules
- **Proper Error Handling**: Custom error types with thiserror
- **Security**: Sensitive information protected with secrecy
- **Maintainability**: Consistent code style and documentation
