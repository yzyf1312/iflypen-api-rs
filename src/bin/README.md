# About Using This CLI Tool

You need to copy the cookie database file from the iFlyTek Hear client to the program's working directory, and place a `data.mp3` file in the working directory.

For the Windows version of iFlyTek Hear client, the cookie database file is located at `%APPDATA%\讯飞听见\Cookies`. You can directly copy this file to the working directory.
